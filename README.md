# cancerFinder
This file takes in images of cells and determines whether or not they are cancerous via a deep learning model.

I did not add the image folders because of how many images are in my folder on my computer. There are over 200,000 images in the file
and I can't put them all in easily. But this is a from a Kaggle competetion, so I'll provide a link below to the competetion where the 
images are available.
